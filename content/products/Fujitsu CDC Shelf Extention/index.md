The Fujitsu CDS mounted with the original 23" brackets places the device 8" from the front of the frame. This creates a problem when trying to close the door or run the AC. The L shape bracket we designed will recede the Fujitsu CDS into the frame. Only the cover plate will be visible from the front of the frame.
