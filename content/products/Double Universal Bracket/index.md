Most routers and network switches are designed for a 19" 4-pole rack. The Rittal cabinet in which these switches will be mounted is a 23" 2-pole frame. This mounting bracket is designed to provide support and stability for the mounted equipment.

This double bracket is designed to support two 1RU devices and will occupy 3RU to allow for ventilation.
